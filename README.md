# Etsy-Scraper

## How it works

This script enables you to scrape recursively, numerous pages of etsy product listings.

Since you can now scrape more than one page of a website automatically via Scrapy library in python, this script
enables you to scrape product's name, tags, ratings, price, image, old price on etsy and then write the result to a csv file in ptython
